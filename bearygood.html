            <h3> Primary Objective</h3>
            <p class="writeup">
                Our goal for the design is to encourage our users to see productivity in a more positive light and
                to create more positive attitudes towards completing schoolwork and other arduous tasks.
            </p>

            <h3> Design </h3>
            <p class="writeup">
                We wanted to incorporate gamification into the app to encourage users to keep coming back and to have a
                consistent productivity streak rather than being productive in bursts. To do this, we decided to
                brainstorm ways for the user to earn rewards but we knew the rewards couldn't be tangible because that
                wouldn't be very feasible. We were inspired by a lot of "plant growing" apps where a user could "grow a
                plant" through staying off of social media for a certain amount of time. <br>
                These apps and about an hour of brainstorm led to: Your friendly neighborhood bear!
                We wanted to create a design that was friendly, welcoming, and fun to
                look at after a long day of schoolwork and day to day tasks. We felt that the bear would give us the
                most amount of customization abilities in terms of rewards. We were also inspired by Animal Crossing and
                its success amongst our peers and even people older than us.
                <br><br>
                If I could describe it in one sentence: <span style="color: #87a0b2; font-weight: bold;">Gamified To-Do
                    List.</span>
            </p>

            <h3> Features </h3>
            <h4> Set Up and Create a Task </h4>
            <p class="writeup"> The user can then add a task by giving it a name and a description, which will pop up if
                the user clicks
                on the apple corresponding to this task on the main page.</p>
            <h4>Completing Tasks and Gaining Rewards</h4>
            <p class="writeup">Once a user finishes a task, the apple will disappear from the page and the number in the
                honey pot will
                increment and the bear will grow as it has “eaten” the apple. Once a user completes 20 tasks, a gift
                will pop up. These gifts will be items that the user can use to customize the bear: shirts, bottoms,
                backgrounds, hats, and more.</p>
            <h4> Closet </h4>
            <p class="writeup">Once tasks are completed and a user earns a gift, they can view it along with all their
                customization
                options in the closet.
            </p>
            <h4>Customizing</h4>
            <p class="writeup">From the closet, the user can reach the customization feature where they can
                change the bear’s
                clothes, background, and accessories.</p>
