                            Cornell students often lack motivation, face burnout, and struggle with procrastination,
                            which
                            are challenges that are often exacerbated by external circumstances. Given the
                            turbulent nature of COVID-19, these challenges become even more relevant as students learn
                            to
                            navigate their lives in nuanced ways. <br><br>
                            We wanted to understand how to tackle this thought process and intervene with design. How
                            can we both encourage productivity in our peers and other college students while challenging
                            the mindset that people have to constantly be working and stressed?

                            supports the existence of this problem? I've included an excerpt from our literature
                            review below. <br><br>

                            Excerpt: <br>
                            How students feel and think
                            about their college experiences impact how they pursue academic, social, and personal goals,
                            thus healthy and positive attitudes are critical for confidence, motivation, and success.
                            Nonetheless, most students’ college experiences are ridden with negative attitudes and
                            practices, including procrastination, burnout, and lack of motivation, that not only harm
                            external measures of success like academic performance but also trap students in toxic
                            physio-psychological cycles that perpetuate such negative attitudes towards school and
                            themselves (Cheng & Icks, 2009; Haycock et al., 1998; Smith & Dillard, 2006; Swan, 2001).

                    </div>

                    <div class="column2 right">
                        <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans';line-height: 30px; margin: 0;"> Findings: Students want to be
                            motivated, see their efforts produce tangible results, and reflect on a well-rounded
                            lifestyle. <br><br> Method: <br>To understand our users we
                            decided to use a diary study as our primary method of user research. Our diary study
                            was conducted using 3 surveys: (1) An
                            introductory survey that gathered preliminary feelings related to
                            productivity, (2) Daily diary entry surveys that allowed participants to reflect on their
                            day and their productivity levels (3) A concluding survey. <br><br>
                        </p>

                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans';line-height: 30px; margin: 0;"> These insights suggest
                    that students tend to feel discouraged because they can't recognize their levels of
                    productivity. Validating their achievements may encourage frequent productivity instead of spurts
                    of energy as seen in certain responses. Furthermore, students want a sense of fulfillment through a
                    balance of personal and school-related activities. <br><br>

                            After gathering our user research, we started to brainstorm. <br><br>
                            Key Pain Points:
                            <i>
                                <li>
                                    Students want a way to reflect on their day and understand their habits.
                                </li>
                            </i>
                            <i>
                                <li>
                                    Students feel that starting projects is difficult which results in procrastination
                                    and
                                    stress.
                                </li>
                            </i>
                            <i>
                                <li>
                                    Students want a balanced life where they can not only focus on schoolwork, but also
                                    their family, friends, and mundane tasks like chores.
                                </li>
                            </i> <br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans';line-height: 30px; margin: 0;">Understanding these
                            pain-points, we designed some key features (shown below). Based on our user research, we
                            know it’s extremely important to help the user recognize their productivity, reward them for
                            completing tasks, and provide incentives to do so. Additionally, we created a mascot as a
                            part of
                            gamification. This bear and apple theme was inspired by the Animal Crossing craze!</p>

                            task, the apple will disappear from the screen
                            and
                            the number in the
                            honey pot will increment and the bear will grow as it has “eaten” the apple. <br>From our
                            user research, we noticed participants still
                            wouldn’t feel productive even if they had been accomplishing tasks all day.<br><br>
                            <b>To combat this, we designed each task accomplishment to be shown physically so that users
                                can see a noticeable change and recognize
                                their productivity.</b><br><br>
                            Once a user completes 20 tasks, a gift will pop up.
                            These gifts will be items that the user can use to customize the bear.

                            much they’ve accomplished for that task. The user can then add a task by giving it a name
                            and a description, which will pop up if the user clicks on the apple corresponding to this
                            task on the main page. <br><br><b>We feel like this type of "to-do" list is more interactive

                            accomplished. <b><br><br>This feature gives the user a timeline of accomplishments since

                            this project turned out! Especially since we were moved to an online class, I feel like we
                            were
                            able to
                            accomplish so much given the circumstances. I think the features we designed were based on
                            the data that we had and targeted the emotions that we understood from the affinity diagram.
                            <br><br>
                            For the next steps, we would test out the design with the stakeholders that we researched
                            using the diary study. I feel like there are certain aspects of the features that we could
                            clean up or iterate on. I would especially like to see how effective our theme (the bear and
                            the apples) was in creating an encouraging and relaxing environment.
